                    <h2>Deep Learning Algorithms for Following Zebrafish Growth</h2>
                    <p>Zebrafish are great test subjects for medical research! But they all look similar, and they grow quickly, which makes it difficult for researchers to accurately identify them for medical trials. Working with my colleagues at Princeton University (<a type="link" id="Princeton" href="https://sites.google.com/view/puchallalab/home?authuser=0"><b>Puchalla Lab,
                    Dept. of Physics</b></a>), I ran sections of the analysis pipeline for a modified deep learning recognition pathway that uses a temporal bootstrapping technique to identify individual zebrafish over several weeks. Our goal is to offer an alternative to more labor intensive and invasive identification methods such as subdermal dye-injection and RFID tag implants (publication in progress). <br>

                    <h2>Statistical Mechanics of Self-Gravitating Systems</h2>
                    <p>Since January 2020, I've been working as a research intern
                    at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (<a type="link" id="PPPL" href="https://www.pppl.gov/"><b>PPPL</b></a>). The projects I work on focus on the statistical mechanics of self-gravitating system as well as comparing then to those of plasma-based systems. As a high school intern, I developed an adaptive integrator (Python/C++) that can model the complex motion of dozens of closely distrbuted particles in space with reasonable accuracy. At the end of Summer 2020, I presented my work at PPPL's Summer Internship Poster Session. As an undergraduate researcher, I'm currently utlizing these algorithims to study and record the underlying energy patterns and discrepancies in these systems (publication in progress). <br> <br>

                    <h2>A Microfluidic Flow System for Studying Single-Particle Kinetics</h2>
                    <p>In the summer of 2019, I worked as a R&D Engineering Intern through Princeton University's Laboratory Learning Program (<a type="link" id = "LLP" href="https://research.princeton.edu/about-us/internships/laboratory-learning-program"><b>LLP</b></a>).
                        As a part of Puchalla Lab, I set up a multi-channel syringe pump system that facilitates single-particle kinetics in PDMS microchannels. To enable users to send various commands involving flow rates/directions, I programmed a user interface with LabVIEW, a graphical programming environment. I also worked on a set of MATLAB scripts that simulate the distribution of fluorescence bursts under various testing conditions. <br><br>
