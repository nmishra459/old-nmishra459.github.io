				<p>This website originally started as one of my problem sets for CS50, "Homepage" that had students code a simple HTML page on a topic of their
					choice. I used the opportunity to get started on making my own personal website, using <b>HTML/CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, and <b>Bootstrap</b>.
					Since then, I've updated this site to help introduce myself, display some projects I've worked on over the years, as well as a dark mode.
					If you'd like to use this website template for your own site, I'd appreciate if you could fork the repository, and give credit on your
					README or on the website itself. I hope you enjoy your look around!<br>

				<p>In March 2021, I was one of 60 college freshmen selected to attend Jane Street's First-Year Trading & Technology Program (<a id="Biopticon" href="https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/our-programs/fttp/"><b>FTTP</b></a>). Grouped
				into teams of three, we competed in an Electronic Trading Challenge (ETC), which had us program a market trader bot (<b>Python</b>)
				that uses TCP connections (<b>Bash</b>), a known fair value of bonds, and discrepancies in the pricing of securities to generate profit in a simulated financial exchange. Some last-minute modifications to our algorithm allowed our team (<i>Psyduck</i>) to jump to 8th place in the final round, despite having spent most of the competition in last due to initial bugs.<br>

			<p>In March 2020, I teamed up with four of my high school friends to compete in the MathWorks Math Modeling Challenge. Together, we researched the U.S. electric
				truck market, developed mathematical models (<b>Python</b>) to predict electric truck usage in the next two decades, and determined ideal economic/environmental
				zones for U.S.-based charging station infrastructure. We compiled our results into a final paper, which placed in the top 19% of 760 submissions.<br>

			<p>In my summers as a high schooler, I spent a lot of time competing in <i>The New York Times</i> Summer Reading Competition, which has students
				submit short essays on their thoughts on online articles they find on the Times's website. My response to Chloe Valdary's "Why I Refuse to Avoid
				White People," as well as the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally, was one of 11 entries selected to be published from almost 9000
				submitted worldwide in 2017. Having my voice heard on such a large platform spurred me to keep writing on my own, until it eventually
				became one of my favorite hobbies!</b><br>
